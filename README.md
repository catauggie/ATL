# Machine Learning-Based Modular Framework for ATL

A modular deep learning framework for real-time control and defect prediction in Automated Tape Laying (ATL), implemented in Python using PyTorch.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **Feature Encoder**  
  Extracts latent representations from:
  - Thermal profiles (e.g., moving average-filtered \( T_P(t) \))
  - 3D point cloud features (geometry, surface normals, curvatures)
  - Process parameters (e.g., speed, power)

- **Thermal Surrogate Head**  
  Predicts peak temperature \( T_{\max} \) and melt dwell time \( \tau_{\text{melt}} \) using a fully connected regression model.

- **Defect Segmentation Head**  
  Classifies point cloud data into defect classes (e.g., normal, wrinkle, gap, overlap) using fused latent features and a segmentation network.

- **Control Policy Head**  
  Outputs deterministic control actions (e.g., laser power, head velocity) to regulate process conditions via a policy network.

- **Training Loop & Inference**  
  Example forward pass, loss computation (including thermal loss, cross-entropy segmentation loss with total variation), and placeholder reinforcement learning head.

## ðŸ“š Description

This framework supports the development of ML-enhanced ATL digital twins. It provides modular components for:

- **Surrogate modeling**: Physics-aware regression of thermal behavior.
- **Semantic segmentation**: Real-time classification of geometric anomalies.
- **Policy control**: Closed-loop control via reinforcement learning strategies.
- **Training & Inference**: Easily extendable pipeline for supervised and hybrid model learning.

The system can be integrated with:
- Custom data loaders (e.g., FEM results, thermal logs, 3D scans)
- Real-time sensor feedback and embedded deployment
- Offline or online policy refinement
